This year, I finished reading <You Don't Know JS> Vol I. This series of books cover a lot of details of JavaScript that might or might not be used in my daily development work. I used to know how to write code to implement some sorts of functionalities. With the help of this book, I come to know why I should write code in this way and moreover, code can be write in another way, which is more maintainable and robuster.

The biggest challenge in this year is the graphic development of Campus in navigation tree module and documentations view of fiber cables in web. I did some preparation like read the API documentation of 3rd party library and write some demo code before starting on my work. Luckily, these two task were well accomplished and as new features come in, it takes few efforts to iterate over the code.

In the past two major versions 6.5.0 and 6.6.0 of our system, I also took charge of developing modules such as 'Quick New' of Projects module and many enhancements and features of existing modules. Meanwhile, I was in charge of the UI development of our internal tool - License Portal. What's more, I worked with Sean to improve the styles of the user interface of our product.
