Of course. Here is a complete English version of the speech, tailored for a technical audience of developers, based on the structure and content we've refined.

### **Title: Co-building the Next-Generation Data Visualization Ecosystem: Developing Your First Component on Our Low-Code Platform**

---

### **Key Takeaways (Speech Outline)**

1.  **A Shared Vision: Co-creating a Data Application Ecosystem**
    * We offer more than a low-code platform; we offer an open, extensible ecosystem. We build the foundation, and you—the developers—are the core creators who bring it to life.

2.  **A Standardized Workflow for Component Development**
    * We provide a complete, standardized workflow covering everything from scaffolding, development, configuration, and testing to publishing. This lets you focus on the component's business logic and user experience.

3.  **Two Core Principles: Separation of Component UI and Configuration**
    * **Component as UI:** Developers use Vue 3 and Naive UI to focus purely on the visual and interactive aspects of the component.
    * **Schema as Configuration:** The component's configuration panel is defined by standard JSON Schema, achieving a clean decoupling of configuration logic from the rendering layer.

4.  **Three Key Benefits: Efficiency, Flexibility, and a Win-Win Partnership**
    * **Efficient Development:** Maximize your development speed with our CLI and automated tools.
    * **Flexible Extensibility:** The platform allows for the registration of arbitrarily complex custom components to meet any business need.
    * **Shared Value:** The components you build will empower thousands of users, creating a win-win scenario of commercial value and technical achievement.

### **Full Speech Content**

#### **Part 1: The Vision (Opening)**

**(Goal: To capture the audience's attention and inspire interest.)**

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for being here today. What I want to talk about isn't just a product or a technology, but an opportunity for us to **create something incredible, together.**"

"In our data-driven world, we've seen a major pain point for business teams and data analysts: they have vast amounts of data and deep business insights, but struggle to quickly and flexibly translate them into intuitive, powerful dashboards. Our low-code platform was born to solve this. **Our mission is to put the power of data visualization directly into the hands of those who are closest to the business.**"

"But to achieve this grand vision, we need a thriving, powerful ecosystem of components. And that's where you come in. We see everyone in this room as the **core architects of this ecosystem**. We provide the stable, efficient platform—the canvas—while you provide the creativity and ingenuity to build the powerful 'Lego bricks' that our users will love."

"That is the journey I’m inviting you to join us on today."

#### **Part 2: The Developer's Journey: A Complete 0-to-1 Workflow**

**(Goal: To clearly and systematically present the entire development process, giving developers confidence.)**

"So, how does a developer contribute a brand-new component to our platform? We've designed a standardized seven-step workflow to ensure the process is clear, efficient, and predictable."

**Step 1: Scaffolding - Say Goodbye to Boilerplate**
"We provide a CLI scaffolding tool. By simply running `npm create our-component-template` in your terminal, you can instantly generate a standardized component development environment, complete with a full project structure, TypeScript configuration, unit testing setup, and Naive UI integration."

**Step 2: Core Component Implementation - Focus on Your Logic**
"Within the generated project, your focus will be entirely on the Vue 3 component inside the `src/` directory. Here, you will:
* **Define a clear `props` interface:** This is the contract between your component and the platform, specifying exactly what data structure your component expects.
* **Implement the UI and interactivity** using Naive UI or any other library of your choice."

**Step 3: Defining the Config Panel - Driven by JSON Schema**
"We don’t write a single line of UI code for the component's configuration panel—the form users see on the right-hand side to configure your component. Instead, you simply provide a standard **JSON Schema** file.
* **Why JSON Schema?** It's a powerful industry standard that completely decouples the *definition* of your configuration from the *rendering* of the configuration UI.
* The platform will automatically parse your schema and render a dynamic, interactive form with built-in data validation."

**Step 4: Adapting the Data Source - Connecting Data to Your Component**
"On the platform, a user selects a 'Dataset' to power your component, for example, 'Historical Data for Device X'. However, the raw data returned from this dataset might not perfectly match the `props` your component needs.
* To solve this, you can define an optional **`transform` function** in your component's metadata.
* This function acts as an **adapter**, taking the raw data from the dataset and transforming it into the exact shape required by your component's `props`."

**Step 5: Registering Your Component - Making the Platform Aware**
"Once development is complete, you register your component in a central configuration file. This 'registry' tells our low-code platform everything it needs to know:
* Its name, like "Advanced Funnel Chart."
* Its icon for the drag-and-drop panel.
* The Vue component file to render.
* The JSON Schema for its configuration panel.
* And other metadata, like default dataset recommendations."

**Step 6: Ensuring Quality - Testing Your Component**
"We strongly encourage and support writing unit tests for every component. Our scaffolding comes with Vitest pre-configured. You should test:
* Your component's props handling logic.
* The data `transform` function.
* Key user interactions and event emissions.
A well-tested component is essential for ensuring stability across thousands of user-built dashboards."

**Step 7: Publishing & Documentation - Sharing Your Creation**
"Finally, using our release tools, you can bundle your component and publish it to our internal private npm registry or component marketplace. We also encourage you to write clear documentation explaining your component's best use cases and configuration options."

#### **Part 3: The Conclusion - Our Promise and Your Invitation**

**(Goal: To reiterate the value proposition and provide a clear call to action.)**

"To summarize, the core principles of our workflow are **'Metadata-Driven'** and **'Separation of Concerns.'**
* **You, the component developer**, focus on just three things: **the UI (`.vue`), the configuration definition (`.json`), and the data transformation (`.ts`).**
* **The platform** handles everything else: dynamic form rendering, data flow, canvas interactions, state management, and more.

"We believe this approach allows us to collectively build an incredibly powerful and flexible data application ecosystem. Every component you contribute becomes a powerful tool that empowers thousands of users to create value."

"To close, we sincerely invite all of you to become the first co-builders of our ecosystem. Here is the link to our **Developer Portal** and our **Community Forum**. There, you will find detailed documentation, component templates, and have the opportunity to connect directly with our core engineering team."

"Let's build the future of data visualization, together. Thank you."
